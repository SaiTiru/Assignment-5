Data Analytics Tools Lab 5: Categorical Feature Encoding Techniques
This repository contains Python code for implementing various techniques to encode categorical features into numeric quantities. The code demonstrates three different methods: replacing values, label encoding, and one-hot encoding, using a sample dataset.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and the following libraries installed:

numpy
pandas


### Installing

Installing
You can install the required libraries using pip:
```
pip install numpy pandas


## Running the tests

The Python script provided in the repository demonstrates how to perform categorical feature encoding using different methods. You can run the script and observe the output to understand the encoding techniques.

### Break down into end to end tests

Part 1: Replacing values
Replaces categorical values with desired numeric quantities using the replace() function in pandas.
Part 2: Label Encoding
Encodes categorical values by assigning numerical labels between 0 and n_categories-1 using the cat.codes method in pandas.
Part 3: One-Hot Encoding
Converts categorical variables into binary vectors using one-hot encoding with the get_dummies() function in pandas.
```

## Deployment

The Python script can be deployed locally on your machine. Simply clone the repository, install the required libraries, and run the script.
